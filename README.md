## Introduction
This guide is designed to help me stay organized and focused while preparing for software engineering interviews. It includes a study plan, resources, practice problems, and tips that I have found useful.

## Study Plan
Outline your study plan here, including topics to cover and a timeline.

### Learning by Doing
Focus on hands-on practice to understand deeper concepts in Python and JavaScript. 

#### Python
- Week 1-2: Basics and Syntax
    - Variables, Data Types, and Operators
    - Control Flow (if statements, loops)
    - Functions and Modules
- Week 3-4: Advanced Topics
    - Object-Oriented Programming
    - Exception Handling
    - File I/O
- Week 5-6: Libraries and Frameworks
    - NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
    - Flask/Django for web development

#### JavaScript
- Week 1-2: Basics and Syntax
    - Variables, Data Types, and Operators
    - Control Flow (if statements, loops)
    - Functions and Scope
- Week 3-4: Advanced Topics
    - Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, Async/Await)
    - DOM Manipulation
    - Event Handling
- Week 5-6: Libraries and Frameworks
    - React.js for building user interfaces
    - Node.js for server-side development

### Timeline
- Allocate 2 hours daily for coding practice.
- Weekly review sessions to consolidate learning.
- Monthly mock interviews to assess progress.

## Practice Problems
Here is a list of practice problems and coding challenges I plan to solve:

### LeetCode Problems
1. **Two Sum** - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) (Easy)
2. **Add Two Numbers** - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/) (Medium)
3. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) (Medium)
4. **Median of Two Sorted Arrays** - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/) (Hard)
5. **Longest Palindromic Substring** - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/) (Medium)
6. **ZigZag Conversion** - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/) (Medium)
7. **Reverse Integer** - [Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/) (Medium)
